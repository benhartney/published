            This is very basic demo of a new way to display political views.
          </p>
          <p>
            The source material is <a href='https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-07-13/eight-charts-show-where-america-stands-in-the-21st-century'>Noah Smith's view on how the US is doing as a country</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've done a non-trival amount of interpretation, and made some alterations for convenience's sake. All errors are my own.</p>
          <p>
            A list of the benefits this format has is further down the page - a major benefit I'll mention here is that live data sources can be connected to the view so that it is automatically kept up-to-date, and a reader doesn't have to hope Smith writes an updated article in a few years time to see how the US is going, according to his view.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can zoom and move around using the standard Google Maps style interactions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The green/red colors reflect whether that specific issue or indicator has been moving in a positive direction (green) or not (red). White indicates that it's ambiguous.
          </p>
          <p>
            The overall goal is to document lots of political views in this format (ideally authored by, or at least signed off by, the viewholder), and house them all in one place.
          </p>
          <p>
            There is some more explanation and detail further down this page, and at <a href='https://medium.com/@benhartney/improving-policy-discussions-1b8be6c7a318'>this post</a>.

        <h4>
          Format benefits
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>In theory, the structure is persistent and canonical - anytime Noah changes his worldview (for example, he could start monitoring an indicator around the average number of close friends people have), it would be added into this existing format, keeping it up-to-date</li>
          <li>The numbers are automatically updated, so it's easier for the viewholder to track how things are going, and readers don't have to wait until the viewholder writes an updated article in a few years time to get an update</li>
          <li>In addition to showing the issues the viewholder cares about and indicators for those issues, it can also show what the viewholder thinks have a causal influence on those issues
            <ul>
              <li>For example, one of Noah's indicators in the article is "absolute mobility" (a person's chance of being richer than their parents), which is falling. The article just talks about overall indicators, and not causes, but the paper he links to lists two causes for the drop in mobility - GDP growth rate and distribution. These have been added to the map.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Smith's article is an exception - most political entities (pundits, think-tanks, parties, politicians etc) don't comprehensively list out all of the indicators they use to determine if the country (or state, town, world) is going well or not. It's a lot more ad-hoc, generally to suit political purposes. If those entities documented their views like this, we'd also get all of the benefit that that rigor brings, as well.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>
          Notes
        </h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Causality flows upwards - e.g. the prime age employment rate impacts Smith's view of the economy which impacts Smith's overall view.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are some connections that could be added - e.g. between GDP growth rate and some of the other items in the economics section.
          </li>
          <li>
            In an ideal world, the view would be so thorough that it would be rare to add something in - any changes in the state of the world that matter to Smith would just be reflected in the existing indicator's getting a data update.
          </li>
          <li>
