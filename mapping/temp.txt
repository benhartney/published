dotted vs solid



item can be defined as good or bad. this is "level"
  suicide:
    anything about 0 is bad. being above historical average is worse. progressively.
  crime:
    probably don't want to be 0 (there's got to be a better example, because you could want it to be 0 and also want civil rights, even if it's infeasible)
  ---
  most can be framed as either, by reversal
  some data ones can't be
    e.g. births by teenage mothers
connection: if item definitions match, positive. otherwise, negative  
  currently displayed in the connection
trend: increase+goodDef=good,increase+badDef=bad,decrease+badDef=good,decrease+goodDef=bad
  increase/decrease currently displayed in text.
    could be in the connection, make it more like a flow
  trend currently displayed via item color



could try to phrase all things as good, it would eliminate an axis from the cognitive load

current:
nothing communicates if item is good/bad
item color communicates trend
not including connection

alt:
using "improve/worsen" communicates item good/bad

alt:
have different lenses. just show me the view structure. use box color to indicate item good/bad. then, show me trend. box color indicates trend.
